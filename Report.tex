\section{Research Questions}
This report is aimed to research on the associations between the severity of COVID-19 and some important 
economics indicators in the UK. More specifically, this report will answer the following questions:\par
\noindent
1) Which COVID-19 severity indicator(s) and which economics indicator(s) have high and significant correlations?\par
\noindent
2) How these severity indicator(s) impact these economics indicator(s)?\par
\noindent
3) Can we build a linear regression to predict some economics indicators with COVID-19 severity indicator(s)?
